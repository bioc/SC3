\description{
This function calculates differentially expressed (DE) genes, marker genes 
and cell outliers based on the consensus \code{SC3} clusterings.
}
\details{
DE genes are calculated using \code{\link{get_de_genes}}. Results of the DE 
analysis are saved as new columns in the 
\code{featureData} slot of the input \code{object}. The column names correspond 
to the adjusted \code{p-value}s of the genes and have the following format: 
\code{sc3_k_de_padj}, where \code{k} is the number of clusters.

Marker genes are calculated using \code{\link{get_marker_genes}}. 
Results of the marker gene analysis are saved as three new 
columns (for each \code{k}) to the 
\code{featureData} slot of the input \code{object}. The column names correspond 
to the \code{SC3} cluster labels, to the adjusted \code{p-value}s of the genes 
and to the area under the ROC curve
and have the following format: \code{sc3_k_markers_clusts}, 
\code{sc3_k_markers_padj} and \code{sc3_k_markers_auroc}, where \code{k} is 
the number of clusters.

Outlier cells are calculated using \code{\link{get_outl_cells}}. Results of the 
cell outlier analysis are saved as new columns in the 
\code{phenoData} slot of the input \code{object}. The column names correspond 
to the \code{log2(outlier_score)} and have the following format: 
\code{sc3_k_log2_outlier_score}, where \code{k} is the number of clusters.

Additionally, \code{biology} item is added to the \code{sc3} slot and is set to
\code{TRUE} indicating that the biological analysis of the dataset has been
performed.
